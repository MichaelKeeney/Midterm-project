# This is where I will put my code block
### This is some python I did for one of my other classes

```
# Calculates the Volume of a cylinder

import math

def cylinder_volume_calc(radius, height):
    parameter = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height

    # This is where the calculations are done based on the user inputs
    
    return parameter

def inputs():
    radius = float(input("Enter Radius of the cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter Hieght of the cylinder: "))

    # User inputs are here
    
    print(cylinder_volume_calc(radius, height))

inputs()
```
## ***BOOM*** There it is
