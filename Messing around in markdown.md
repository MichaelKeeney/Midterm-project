# This is my main header
## This is a subheader

This is a parahraph where I talk about random things such as why I am doing this. I am doing this for a midterm project in my IT class. I have no idea what I am doing. It is a mircle I have made it this far. Though I am doing better than some people, which is good I suppose. I am going to stop talking in this paragraph.

In this paragraph I wanted to mess around with syntax. For example I can be like **bold** with what I say or I can be *sly* or I can be ***both***. This way of making a website seems a lot easiser to understand than HTML and easier to read.

Here is a link to one of my favorite webistes [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/).
